I have been wanting to develop an mobile app for my Malayalam language learning students for a long time. I made an attempt back in 2020-21 using React Native and Expo. But due to many similar apps like that in the market, my app was reject by Apple App Store. I couldn't get back to it due to other commitments. But here I am again, trying to build a web app using React 18 with my web development experience so far 🚀. This time, it is going to be different, as I am using TDD, clean code principles to build a stable app.

As I have laid the foundation for the app, I jumped right in by refining the ideas on paper and got some stories on my Jira board.

I am currently building a Vocabulary builder for my language learning students using the following stack 🧱

- Frontend using - React 18, Typescript and Tailwind CSS
- Backend - Firebase
- Unit testing - Jest & testing-library for React

So far, I have built the following pages for the site.

1. SignUp page
2. Login Page
3. Admin Page - Where the Admin can enter values in CSV format

> Following is the demo 📹 ⏯️ of the admin page where the data is entered in CSV format.

P.S - There is a short lag after pressing the button. If you have patience for 5 more seconds, then you will see a toast message that the words are added successfully. 🤞
