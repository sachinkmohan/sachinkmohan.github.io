I got inspiration to create this page from [Derek Silver Page](https://sive.rs/now). Not only me, a lot of people have picked inspiration from him. Do check it out ðŸ˜‰!

## My Current Project

I am currently building a Vocabulary builder for my language learning students using the following stack ðŸ§±

- Frontend using - React, Typescript and Tailwind
- Backend - Firebase
- Unit testing - Jest

So far, I have built the following pages for the site.
- SignUp page
- Login Page
- Admin Page - Where the Admin can enter values in CSV format

My thoughts - I had a lot of fun building so far. As it is a new project, I had few difficulties setting it up in terms of unit tests and typescript configurations.
