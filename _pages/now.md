I got inspiration ðŸ’ª to create this page from [Derek Silver Page](https://sive.rs/now). Not only me, a lot of people have picked inspiration from him. Do check it out ðŸ˜‰!

## Main Project

Current focus is on migrating Vue 2 into Vue 3 using Nuxt 3.

Learnings so far: âœ…

- Vue 3 Composition API
- Nuxt 3
- Pinia for state management
- changes from Vuetify 2 to Vuetify 3
- Typescript

## My Current Side Project

I am currently building a Vocabulary builder for my language learning students using the following stack ðŸ§±

- Frontend using - React, Typescript and Tailwind
- Backend - Firebase
- Unit testing - Jest

So far, I have built the following pages for the site.

- SignUp page
- Login Page
- Admin Page - Where the Admin can enter values in CSV format

My thoughts ðŸ§  - I had a lot of fun building so far. As it is a new project, I had few difficulties setting it up in terms of unit tests and typescript configurations.

Current status ðŸš§ ðŸ”–

- Setup Layout for the site.
- Navigation bar is also done.
- Need to fix mocking for the import.meta problem in the firebase config file.
