1. Send shorter issues, more frequently

2. Replies are the most valuable metric

3. The “letter” part is more important than the “news” part

(Stole that one from the brilliant Ann Handley)

4. Write TO one person, not AT a lot of people

5. Don’t be afraid to promote your stuff - it’s not a selfish act, it’s a generous one

(If you have value to offer)

6. It’s OK to skip an issue

7. Sender name is more important than subject line

8. If it’s boring to write, it’ll be boring to read

9. Always ask yourself what someone can do AFTER reading your newsletter that they couldn’t do before

10. Delete 10% of the words before hitting publish
